# About
A online friend asked me for feedback on an art piece. What followed was several months of back-and-forth and glimpses into decisions made to turn the piece into a final result. 
Each stage of creation is associated with a short conversation - a question about technique, composition, concept - revealing the magnitude of decion-making needed to create just one artwork.
