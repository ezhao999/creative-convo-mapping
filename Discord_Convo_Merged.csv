"2022-01-25,03:50:33",Fluffel,1,"Super rough sketch of assignment A, my topic was social anxiety",,
"2022-01-25,03:50:36",Fluffel,1,Lmk anything I should change or add lol,,
"2022-01-25,03:55:12",Fluffel,1,It's still in the early stages and tbh I had another idea with a man in a mesh mask dancing with a skeleton lol,,
"2022-01-25,09:05:41",FryingHamster,1,so you’re portraying social anxiety as walking a tightrope?,,
"2022-01-25,09:05:53",FryingHamster,1,also what us going on below the tightrope?,,
"2022-01-25,09:58:32",Fluffel,1,Yeah,,
"2022-01-25,10:04:04",Fluffel,1,Below I was going to draw some pedestrians,,
"2022-01-25,10:04:33",Fluffel,1,There was something I was going to do but the sketch doesn't show it lol,,
"2022-01-25,10:27:50",FryingHamster,1,i think you can push the metaphor a bit further than pedestrians,,

"2022-01-25,10:35:27",Fluffel,1,I was planning on doing that,,
"2022-01-25,10:36:07",Fluffel,1,"Like I wanted to either make a shadow, make the tightrope, and make the hands kind of like a window into everyone mocking you or something",,
"2022-01-25,10:39:57",FryingHamster,1,for sure,,
"2022-01-25,10:40:17",FryingHamster,1,i would be a few thumbnails of your ideas because i think the background will sell this piece or not,,
"2022-01-25,10:40:23",FryingHamster,1,would make*,,
"2022-01-25,10:40:58",Fluffel,1,"honestly yeah, I'm probably going to thumbnail after class or something",,

"2022-01-25,14:37:25",Fluffel,2,"Also here are 3 super quick thumbnails, the shaded parts basically mean that it's the perception thing",,
"2022-01-25,14:38:15",FryingHamster,2,excellent execution,,
"2022-01-25,14:38:28",FryingHamster,2,i'll look at the thumbnails later,,
"2022-01-25,14:39:56",Fluffel,2,oki,,
"2022-01-25,16:54:16",FryingHamster,2,i can’t tell the difference,,
"2022-01-25,16:54:28",FryingHamster,2,is it just lighting of the main figure?,,
"2022-01-25,17:44:23",Fluffel,2,No not lighting,,

"2022-01-25,18:28:15",Fluffel,3,"This is half the sketch so far, lmk what to change lol",,
"2022-01-25,19:43:56",FryingHamster,3,interesting but how about,,
"2022-01-25,19:44:03",FryingHamster,3,make those faces BIG,,
"2022-01-25,19:44:08",FryingHamster,3,I don’t just want a crowd,,
"2022-01-25,19:44:14",FryingHamster,3,i’m scared on that tightrope,,
"2022-01-25,19:44:30",Fluffel,3,Like the faces in the rope itself?,,
"2022-01-25,19:44:43",FryingHamster,3,i meant bigger faces in general,,
"2022-01-25,19:44:44",Fluffel,3,Tho I do want to convey it's more of a mental than real life thing,,
"2022-01-25,19:44:45",FryingHamster,3,brb,,
"2022-01-25,21:47:47",FryingHamster,3,hang on ill make a quick doodle,,
"2022-01-25,21:47:59",Fluffel,3,okok,,
"2022-01-25,21:53:28",FryingHamster,3,wait a sec,,
"2022-01-25,21:53:35",FryingHamster,3,what medium are you doing this with,,
"2022-01-25,21:54:33",Fluffel,3,"fineliner, doing the pencil sketch rn",,
"2022-01-25,21:55:38",FryingHamster,3,so just black and white,,
"2022-01-25,21:55:52",Fluffel,3,i might do a bit of color for the rope,,
"2022-01-25,21:57:27",FryingHamster,3,what direction are the faces looking in your sketch?,,
"2022-01-25,21:57:33",FryingHamster,3,have they noticed the MC yet?,,
"2022-01-25,21:57:58",Fluffel,3,"they aren't supposed to notice the MC, only the people actually in the rope do",,

"2022-01-25,22:02:24",FryingHamster,3,i like the subtlety of your current composition but you might need to make things more blatantly obvious,,
"2022-01-25,22:02:45",FryingHamster,3,right now i couldn't tell the difference bt the rope people and the crowd below,,
"2022-01-25,22:02:52",Fluffel,3,ohhh okok,,
"2022-01-25,22:02:53",FryingHamster,3,they just form a collective crowd,,
"2022-01-25,22:03:05",FryingHamster,3,think of it like this,,
"2022-01-25,22:03:17",Fluffel,3,i could make crowd ppl look a bit obv,,
"2022-01-25,22:03:23",FryingHamster,3,"i should be able to get a message out of it standing 5 feet away, not just looking closely at it",,
"2022-01-25,22:03:26",FryingHamster,3,^^^,,
"2022-01-25,22:04:00",Fluffel,3,but at the same time i wanna make only the ppl in the rope obvious because,,
"2022-01-25,22:04:43",Fluffel,3,i kind of wanted the message to be like believing people are mocking you when they aren't,,
"2022-01-25,22:04:45",Fluffel,3,stuff like that,,
"2022-01-25,22:06:24",FryingHamster,3,"maybe a tightrope isn't the best metaphor then. Because right now, the rope is the only thing holding your MC up, and it seems like the way they are metaphorically surviving is by continuing to walk the tightrope? i'm not sure why the crowd below isn't scarier",,
"2022-01-25,22:07:23",Fluffel,3,ohhhh trutru,,
"2022-01-25,22:07:58",Fluffel,3,i'd make the crowd scarier then lol,,
"2022-01-25,22:08:06",Fluffel,3,rip gonna die drawing more,,
"2022-01-25,22:08:23",FryingHamster,3,man just try the style of the drunk MV,,
"2022-01-25,22:08:39",FryingHamster,3,i personally think having a void and just those faces as white would look great,,
"2022-01-25,22:09:02",Fluffel,3,ooooh wait,,
"2022-01-25,22:09:03",Fluffel,3,what if,,
"2022-01-25,22:09:04",Fluffel,3,what if,,
"2022-01-25,22:09:07",Fluffel,3,i made them all wear like,,
"2022-01-25,22:09:09",Fluffel,3,opera masks,,
"2022-01-25,22:09:23",FryingHamster,3,yeah i was trying to hint at that in the doodle LOL,,
"2022-01-25,22:09:38",Fluffel,3,lmaoooo,,
"2022-01-25,22:09:40",Fluffel,3,okok tyy,,
"2022-01-25,22:09:59",Fluffel,3,honestly i feel like making the crowd feel like a void,,
"2022-01-25,22:10:00",Fluffel,3,like,,
"2022-01-25,22:10:09",Fluffel,3,"make the overall tone darker, like it's all in shadow",,
"2022-01-25,22:10:23",FryingHamster,3,yeah for sure,,
"2022-01-25,22:10:30",Fluffel,3,okok tyyy,,
"2022-01-25,22:10:38",Fluffel,3,i have a more solid idea then lolol,,
"2022-01-25,22:10:47",FryingHamster,3,"just try it at this point, I know you can crank out a rough value thumbnail in no time",,
"2022-01-25,22:11:10",Fluffel,3,"ill do that, ill add in opera masks and then i'll do a value thumb lol",,
"2022-01-25,22:11:13",Fluffel,3,like,,
"2022-01-25,22:11:19",Fluffel,3,somewhat remake the faces on a few,,

"2022-01-25,22:39:50",Fluffel,4,Something closer to this?,,
"2022-01-25,22:39:56",Fluffel,4,I feel like I want to make it feel like a spotlight,,
"2022-01-25,22:40:03",Fluffel,4,Almost like a show/circus,,
"2022-01-25,22:40:37",FryingHamster,4,there can be frowning faces too,,
"2022-01-25,22:40:43",FryingHamster,4,but otherwise much improved,,
"2022-01-25,22:40:47",Fluffel,4,oh i could add some okok,,
"2022-01-25,22:40:54",Fluffel,4,i still really want to make it like a circus lolol,,
"2022-01-25,22:40:57",FryingHamster,4,"you could even make the faces bigger, they don't HAVE to be in scale",,
"2022-01-25,22:41:09",Fluffel,4,"oo defo, it makes it creepy ngl",,
"2022-01-25,23:03:46",FryingHamster,4,hopefully this doesn't influence your final piece but i took a stab at the social anxiety theme,,

"2022-01-25,23:04:09",Fluffel,4,oh wait ngl that is a pretty cool idea,,
"2022-01-25,23:04:22",Fluffel,4,tbh it's a bit too late to influence it lol but tis very cool lol,,
"2022-01-25,23:04:32",FryingHamster,4,oh good that's what i wanted to hear,,

"2022-01-26,02:46:10",Fluffel,5,I'm planning on doing a thing where I so more realistic rendering on the figure and go abstract for the crowd,,
"2022-01-26,11:38:37",FryingHamster,5,lookin sharp btw,,
"2022-01-26,11:39:09",FryingHamster,5,but make sure that void is PITCH BLACK because the contrast bt that and the very white masks is gonna make break your piece,,
"2022-01-26,12:49:45",Fluffel,5,Ohhhh ok,,
"2022-01-26,12:49:52",Fluffel,5,Ngl I kind of want to add red to it,,
"2022-01-26,12:49:55",Fluffel,5,Like the void lol,,

"2022-01-26,22:26:57",Fluffel,6,:D,,
"2022-01-26,22:27:04",FryingHamster,6,i like the hatching style you did for the hands,,
"2022-01-26,22:27:18",Fluffel,6,"ah that's good lol, i got a bit of crit for one hand lol",,
"2022-01-26,22:27:32",FryingHamster,6,was it the left one,,
"2022-01-26,22:27:37",Fluffel,6,yeah LOL,,
"2022-01-26,22:27:48",FryingHamster,6,dw about it,,
"2022-01-26,22:27:50",FryingHamster,6,"what you COULD try for the void is to do a mix of red and black like you want, take a good picture,",,
"2022-01-26,22:27:57",FryingHamster,6,and then color it pitch back,,
"2022-01-26,22:27:58",FryingHamster,6,black,,
"2022-01-26,22:28:02",Fluffel,6,that's exactly what i was gonna do it^^,,
"2022-01-26,22:28:05",Fluffel,6,well,,
"2022-01-26,22:28:11",Fluffel,6,i'm gonna thumbnail to see which one i like more,,
"2022-01-26,22:28:49",FryingHamster,6,the red could really sell social interaction as a personal hell kind of thing but it could also distract from the main figure which you need to understand the story,,
"2022-01-26,22:29:11",Fluffel,6,honestlyy,,
"2022-01-26,22:30:24",Fluffel,6,"ok here's the thing, i wanted to do like a vignette in the crowd in order to kind of center on the feet and right hand",,
"2022-01-26,22:30:35",Fluffel,6,ill do a thumb of it but i feel like it would defo help w/ comp,,
"2022-01-26,22:31:20",FryingHamster,6,"oh yeah definitely, do vignetting with both the detail of the faces as well as the darkness",,
"2022-01-26,22:31:24",Fluffel,6,oo yeah ^^,,
"2022-01-26,22:32:47",FryingHamster,6,man giving crit is so fun when you don't have to do the art itself LOL,,

"2022-01-27,22:26:46",FryingHamster,8,ooh could worth trying,,
"2022-01-27,22:27:04",FryingHamster,8,but what i’m more worried about is that even the vignetting on the edges right now is very light,,
"2022-01-27,22:27:10",FryingHamster,8,this has to be a,,
"2022-01-27,22:27:12",FryingHamster,8,DARK,,
"2022-01-27,22:27:16",FryingHamster,8,void,,
"2022-01-27,22:27:34",FryingHamster,8,for the effect to work. right now i’m having trouble even separating the hands from the background,,
"2022-01-27,22:27:43",Fluffel,8,oh okok,,
"2022-01-27,22:27:52",Fluffel,8,yeah i thought that was weird as well,,

"2022-01-28,18:18:36",FryingHamster,9,ok so,,
"2022-01-28,18:29:39",FryingHamster,9,squint your eyes at the pic you just sent me,,
"2022-01-28,18:29:56",FryingHamster,9,and tell me what you see in terms of value,,
"2022-01-28,18:43:40",Fluffel,9,Wdym in terms of value,,
"2022-01-28,18:43:42",Fluffel,9,Like,,
"2022-01-28,18:43:58",Fluffel,9,ik the hands do fade into the bg a bit,,
"2022-01-28,18:44:04",Fluffel,9,And so does the rope,,
"2022-01-28,18:44:18",Fluffel,9,But I think after adding in color it might pop it out,,
"2022-01-28,18:54:09",FryingHamster,9,if this were in real life would the pit down below be as bright as the main figure?,,
"2022-01-28,19:18:00",Fluffel,9,Ohhhh true true the pit would have a darker value,,
"2022-01-28,19:18:19",Fluffel,9,I was worried it wouldn't pop out as much but ur right lol,,
"2022-01-28,19:24:33",FryingHamster,9,here which one is more compelling,,
"2022-01-28,19:24:38",FryingHamster,9,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746160858555613356/936778834345353277/IMG_3330.jpg,FALSE

"2022-01-28,19:24:51",Fluffel,9,Oh prob second lol,,
"2022-01-28,19:26:30",FryingHamster,9,here i added the small ellipses as faces using the existing value above,,
"2022-01-28,19:26:33",FryingHamster,9,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746160858555613356/936779315222302730/IMG_3332.jpg,FALSE
"2022-01-28,19:26:43",FryingHamster,9,and i added one more layer of value around the faces,,
"2022-01-28,19:26:52",Fluffel,9,Ahhh,,
"2022-01-28,19:26:56",FryingHamster,9,see the difference that the global value makes?,,
"2022-01-28,19:27:05",Fluffel,9,Yee,,
"2022-01-28,19:27:06",Fluffel,9,Ty!,,
"2022-01-28,19:27:25",FryingHamster,9,yessir,,
"2022-01-28,19:35:08",FryingHamster,9,one thing i’d do in procreate is to mask out just the figure and paint a layer of black just to see the difference it makes,,
"2022-01-28,19:35:28",Fluffel,9,I've done that a few times but I'll see,,
"2022-01-28,19:35:43",FryingHamster,9,i’m just trying to figure out how you’re gonna make the whole pit darkest,,
"2022-01-28,19:35:55",Fluffel,9,Yeah lol,,
"2022-01-28,19:35:59",FryingHamster,9,the current hatching looks nice so be careful about adding too many lines,,
"2022-01-28,22:38:37",Fluffel,9,^^ that was something I'm worried about,,

"2022-02-16,01:57:41",Fluffel,10,oh,,
"2022-02-16,01:57:41",Fluffel,10,Also,,

"2022-02-16,08:21:58",FryingHamster,10,i think it’s a good start,,
"2022-02-16,08:22:22",FryingHamster,10,also consider darkening the edges of the crowd a ton more,,
"2022-02-16,08:22:31",FryingHamster,10,i’ll try it in procreate,,
"2022-02-16,09:20:51",Fluffel,10,Hmm maybe,,
